        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Makersquare Blog Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate GIT. Well, it’s a love hate relationshhip. Meaning, when it does as I ask of it, i love it. When it stumps me to the point of pulling every hair out of my head, i loath it. Um, I might just be in over my head.
However, this girl loves a good challenge. It’s funny…as soon as frustration with git is about to takeover, i find myself engrossed in the process. Some people might not like learning…i happen to love it…when it is going my way. When it is not and i cannot find the answers to my questions anywhere is when I feel defeated. But then, I simply pull up Elyse’s email and she always has the answer…in a very helpful way. Love that. Really loving the journey thus far. Let’s pray i can find a way to get GIT on Team Wendi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Outta Here</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yea. Git…as in, GIT OUTTA HERE! I struggled with it today–but stackoverflow and facebook peeps came to my rescue. Thank the Lord for all of them.I really love it when people are helpful. What i do not like is when i ask a question and someone acts put out—as if they have this entire development knowledge under their belt. Know what I think of people like that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they suck. 
Big time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the good news is I have a great group of people around me…Mae, Flip and Elyse are truly the bomb. It was a hard week—Tate was out sick causing me to stream from home twice this week. Not a good thing as far as catching up…but i’m doing it…and doing a pretty damn good job, if i do say so myself!
Um…i might NOT be in over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
