Okay, i admit it...i was hiding...from ALL OF YOU.

Some days are just <em> easier </em> than others i suppose. Whether it's the stacks and stacks of edits i need to do at work...or the never ending list of homework assignments, or final and the most important duty i need to tend to, and that would be, ensuring my son is completing all of HIS homework assignments.
