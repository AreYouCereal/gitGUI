Yea. Git...as in, GIT OUTTA HERE! I struggled with it today--but stackoverflow and facebook peeps came to my rescue. Thank the Lord for all of them.I really love it when people are helpful. What i do not like is when i ask a question and someone acts put out---as if they have this entire development knowledge under their belt. Know what I think of people like that? 

I think they suck. 
Big time. 

But the good news is I have a great group of people around me...Mae, Flip and Elyse are truly the bomb. It was a hard week---Tate was out sick causing me to stream from home twice this week. Not a good thing as far as catching up...but i'm doing it...and doing a pretty damn good job, if i do say so myself!
Um...i might NOT be in over my head.
